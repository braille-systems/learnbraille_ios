#learnbraille_ios

## Product description

**"Learn Braille"** is an app for learning Braille from scratch.

## Advantages over analogues 

<ol>
<li>In the AppStore there is not a single application in Russian with similar functionality</li>
<li>The application will have an intuitive interface and interaction</li>
<li>The developed application will be universal, since it can be used with the same interface on Android, Web and iPhone </li>
</ol>

## Relevance 

The topic is relevant, since the Android application is currently in demand, and iPhone owners do not have the opportunity to use it. Thus, we expand the possibilities of using the application for different types of devices.
