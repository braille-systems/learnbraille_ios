# "Learn Braille" IOS application




## Product description



**"Learn Braille"** is an app for learning Braille from scratch.



This application is aimed at *persons with late-onset blindness*, *visually impaired people* and *parents of blind children*. It is a step-by-step Braille course, practical exercises and a six-point vocabulary for each of the Braille characters.



## Advantages over analogues




1. In the AppStore there is not a single application in Russian with similar functionality

2. The application will have an intuitive interface and interaction

2. The developed application will be universal, since it can be used with the same interface on Android, Web and iPhone



## Relevance



The topic is relevant, since the Android application is currently in demand, and iPhone owners do not have the opportunity to use it. Thus, we expand the possibilities of using the application for different types of devices
